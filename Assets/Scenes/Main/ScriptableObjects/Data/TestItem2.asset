  Description: "Test item description that is very very long.\nPerhaps too long.
    Who's to say?\nNot you, that's for sure. You're playing the game. While I'm writing
    it. Silly bill.\nSilliest bill in the mill if I dare say.\nNot even my dog (Indie)
    is sillier than you. \nAnd that is quite the insult, for he is sillier than a
    cat, sillier than a pig, a frog, a sheep.\nName anything that may be sillier
    than he, and you will only have one right answer, and it be ye."
